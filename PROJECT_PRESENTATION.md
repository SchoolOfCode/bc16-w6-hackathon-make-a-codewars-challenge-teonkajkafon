### our approach & evaluation

**Starting point:** We agreed to start at 9am with our planning and one MVP completed.  
**Check-ins:** We agreed to have group check-ins every 15 minutes.  
**5-min rule:** We set a rule that anyone stuck on something for more than 5 mins should bring the whole team onboard to help with problem solving.

## Brainstorming

As a team we brainstormed various ideas and discussed each one to guage how feasible it would be to implement them within the given timeframe. Our discussions also considered the adaptability of the idea, in order to plan for clear MVPs and tests.
